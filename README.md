### Football managment app

### Overview
This was my final project for Spark bootcamp test. I was given the design for this app (in .jpegs) to reproduce it, everything was made with custom CSS.  
This was real a pleasure to work with, coming up with creative solutions especially because this was my first bigger project with Vue.

### INFO
- I used all common features of Vue: **VueX (although this can be omitted I wanted to practice using vuex store), Vue Router, Lists, etc...** 
- Grid system was the most difficult part, I used Grid CSS and attaching different classes for positions  
- I also constructed **custom directive for closing elements when clicking outside of them.** (especially proud of this lol)  
- Five star rating system was custom made  


**How to start the app**

Download the code & run **npm install** to install dependencies before starting the app.

Then invoke starting script: **npm run serve**
